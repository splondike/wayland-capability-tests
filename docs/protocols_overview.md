This document gives a short overview of the main protocols through which Wayland compositor functionality is exposed to external programs. I've also linked out to longer explanations. Individual compositors may have their own additional methods for accessing functionality, but those aren't documented here. E.g. GNOME and KDE allow installing custom extensions which get privileged access but aren't interoperable.

Essentially there are three protocols we use:

- [Wayland procotols](https://github.com/splondike/wayland-accessibility-notes/blob/main/wayland-compositors.md) - The core/stable protocols allow applications to do things like open a window and draw its contents. These would be implemented in a consistent way by all compositors. Compositors may also add additional protocols that do things like let the user move the mouse cursor that may not be available across all compositors. So far nobody's using any authorization framework for this as far as I'm aware, meaning you can't sandbox apps off from particular exposed features.
- [XDG Desktop Portals](https://github.com/splondike/wayland-accessibility-notes/blob/main/xdg-desktop-portal.md) - A set of [DBus](https://github.com/splondike/wayland-accessibility-notes/blob/main/dbus.md) interfaces that provide useful functionality to applications. Requests can be authorized, allowing for application sandboxing.
- [libei](https://libinput.pages.freedesktop.org/libei/) - Allows injection of emulated keyboard/mouse events. I believe this is intended as a supporting protocol to the XDG Desktop Portal RemoteDesktop functionality set [replacing an older DBus based input injection method](https://github.com/rustdesk/rustdesk/discussions/4515). You can get a handle to a libei server via RemoteDesktop.
